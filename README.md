# Quadrupled Robot Cat with Ultrasonic Obstacle Detection

3D-modelled a cat head to hold an ultrasonic sensor. Writing code to detect obstacles and stop stepping forward when detecting one. The cat head stl file has been attached, I designed the size just for the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. If you are using other ultrasonic sensors please check the size before printing the head out.

## Ultrasonic Sensor

We followed [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/2hwrDSVHQ-E?si=r23-D5WEpFWe9gQz) for the implementation of ultrasonic obstacle detection.
